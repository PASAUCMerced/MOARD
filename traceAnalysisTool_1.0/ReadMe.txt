The README for the traceAnalysisTool
Summary: this traceAnalysisTool is developed to analyze the trace generated by LLVM Tracer, which is a trace generation tool based on LLVM IR. More specifically, the traceAnaylsisTool is to count the fault vulnerability rate of the source program of the input program.
The input trace is produced by the LLVM Tracer program;
The trace of the target program is then read into the traceAnaylsisTool;
A counter is created to count the fault-masking events happening on the target data structure;
A proposed metric is used for quantify the fault vulnerability rate of the target data structure of the input progam.
